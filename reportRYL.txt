lm:
First of all, we made 19 new columns to display different genres to the merged dataset(and we know TA will test our 
code with a data file contains those new columns). Then we restored ZIP columns with only first two digits. The reason 
is that we want to do dimention reduction and ZIP codes are arranged so the first two digits could still give us region 
information. To do so, we converted ZIP column data to be strings and only keep the first two characters and converted 
them back to factor. Then we attempted to do linear regression with those basic features besides userID and movieID as 
our predictors. The reason we did not include userID and movieID was we believed those two features would not affect rating
a lot(graph?) since userID and movieID only stand for users and items general, which also are represented by other features 
that have stronger relation with rating. With these basic features, cross validation gave us a mean absolute prediction error
of 0.889 which was kind off too much. To improve the accurancy of prediction, we added two new features as our predictors: mean
of user rating and mean of movie rating. The reason was we found some users tend to give higher rating than others while some
movies tends to get higher rating than others, which was also ture in real world. And we knew that people in different ages
had different preference of movies and males and females had different preference as well. Then we attempted to combine these two
features by multiplying their values (gender is dummy with value 0 and 1). By using updated predictors, we got a MAPE of 0.697
which was better than previous one.
